# pulsar_package (Resource)

Manages Pulsar packages that store runnable artifacts for functions, sources, and sinks. Packages are referenced by
other resources via their fully-qualified URL (`<type>://<tenant>/<namespace>/<name>@<version>`). The provider uploads
the local archive file, keeps metadata (description, contact, properties) in sync, and tracks the local file checksum
so Terraform detects archive changes.

> **Important:** The archive file referenced by `path` must exist on the machine running `terraform plan`/`apply`
> because the provider computes the SHA256 checksum to trigger updates when the file contents change.

- `file_size` (Number) Archive size reported by Pulsar (bytes).
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `modification_time` (Number) Server-side package modification timestamp (epoch millis).
